<h1>🐾 Mewdy Miso - Game Jam Project</h1>
Mewdy Miso is a short, point-and-click style narrative driven game created for the Game Parade Jam. Your mission? Keep your daughter's beloved cat well-fed and happy while she is gone for work — but be careful! Give him the wrong food or ignore his needs, and he might just tear the whole flat apart!

🕹️ Gameplay
Feed Miso (the cat) the correct food at the right time.

Watch out for signs of mischief — an angry cat means chaos!

Take on this feedback from Miso on your next play-loop till you meet Miso's needs!

🔧 Status
This project is currently in development as part of the Game Parade Jam. Stay tuned for updates, improvements, and full gameplay!
